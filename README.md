# Dash Orb Practice Fix
A mod that makes it so you can place checkpoints while holding a dash orb, and lets you continue holding dash orbs after you respawn from those checkpoints.
## "Affect Platformer Checkpoints" Setting
This mod has a setting that, when enabled, makes it so the dash orb persistence applies to the platformer-only "checkpoint" objects in normal mode, not just checkpoints from practice mode.  
This setting is off by default.
# Incompatibilities
This mod is incompatible with the "Platformer Saves" and "Persistence API" mods due to internal reasons. If someone wants to make a pull request to fix this, be my guest.
